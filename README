PyQtPaint

A quick little boilerplate of a PyQt widget that allows drawing lines in layers over a backgrond image.

Using the RMB context menu you can copy and paste, clean and save the layers.

This was a test I did for an app that would let designers mark up images for guides.

You'll need PyQt and PIL.
